<h1> * Dice Game * </h1>
<p> 
  Challenge your friends to a game of high stakes, using nothing more than a simple dice! 
 
  Here are the rules:
  <ul>
   <li>
      The game has 2 players, playing in rounds.
   </li>
   <li>
      In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he/she wishes. Each result gets added to his ROUND score.
   </li>
   <li>
      BUT, if the first player rolls a 1, all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn.
   </li>
   <li>
      The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that ROUND score gets added to their GLOBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn.
   </li>
   <li>
      The first player to reach 100 points on the GLOBAL score wins the game!
   </li>
  </ul>
</p>
